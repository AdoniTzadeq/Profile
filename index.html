            <b> Neena Mathew was born on 21st November 1993 on the first day of the week to Marykutty and Mathew in Kozhikode district of Kerala. Her grandparents were one of those who migrated from Kottayam to Malabar decades ago. These grandparents worked hard and gave inheritance to her Father mathew.  Thereby the home she lived had coconut, aracant and cashew plantations. There was a river flowing a little far from her home. She enjoyed the blissful fresh waters when she lives away from her hometown in bangalore.
                Her Father was working in school as a Teacher and her Mother was managing the livestocks and her family. 
               She traveled to a few parts of India like Chhattisgarh, Bangalore in India for her education and work. Her mother tongue is Malayalam,  she has a basic understanding of Hindi and is able to handle English.
               She was a dreamer. Having realistic dreams and developing persistence to acquire them was a new area of knowledge for her. Thereby she is shifting her career from Early Childhood Education to the Programming field.  Because, grown ups have to meet the real life and that is different from the comfort that she found in the daily school.  She understood that behaviorism was used perfectly in school. But it is very dangerous to adopt in real life. Successful people outlived the instincts of behavior. Humans strive for growth. And she believes that humans need to be capable in many areas and that helps them to have interdomain knowledge and thereby she can learn based on her current needs of her life and hope for the better.
